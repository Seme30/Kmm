# Building Cross-Platform Applications with Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile

We all know that Kotlin has become a go-to language for Android development. But did you know that Kotlin isn’t just for Android anymore? With Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile (KMM), we can now use Kotlin for cross-platform development, creating applications for Android, iOS, Desktop, and Web. 

Let’s dive into the world of cross-platform Kotlin and see what it has to offer!

## Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile (KMM)

KMM allows developers to write the business logic once and share it across multiple platforms. This leads to significant benefits such as code reusability, reduced development time, and the flexibility of native programming.

Moreover, KMM compiles code into the format of the targeted platform, ensuring native performance. 

## Jetpack Compose Multiplatform

If you decide to focus on UI, Jetpack Compose Multiplatform allows sharing UIs across Android, iOS, desktop, and web.

## A Simple Demonstration of KMM

Let’s take a look at a simple yet effective demonstration of KMM. Nothing fancy, just an about screen to showcase KMM. 

### Android

### Desktop

Moving on to the desktop version, the app maintains consistent functionality with its Android counterpart. The UI elements are responsive and adapt well to larger screens, showcasing the flexibility of Jetpack Compose Multiplatform.
